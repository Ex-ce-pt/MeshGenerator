# Mesh Generator

## Description

A really bad algorithm for triangulating a shape.

The task originally was to have a rectangle, put some holes in it (regular polygons) and triangulate the resulting shape.

Implemented it just for fun.

## How to run

1. Open `mesh_generator.py` and change `config` to your preferred value.
2. Run the `mesh_generator.py` file.
3. Enjoy the fireworks!
